# Threat Hunting in the Healthcare Sector using MITRE ATT&CK

## Project Overview
This project applies the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to proactive threat hunting in the healthcare sector.  
The research focused on identifying **APT groups** targeting healthcare, analyzing their **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**, and visualizing attack patterns to understand common threat vectors.

---

## Objectives
1. Understand and apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework in a real-world scenario.  
2. Identify APT groups targeting the healthcare sector.  
3. Map their TTPs in the **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator**.  
4. Perform comparative analysis to highlight overlapping attack methods.  

---

## Tools & Resources
- **SOCRadar Labs** – Healthcare-focused APT intelligence  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** – Visualization of TTP mappings  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** – Standardized taxonomy of adversary behaviors  
- **OSINT Sources** – Cross-checking APT details and attack vectors  

---

## Project Steps
1. **Studied MITRE ATT&CK** structure of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures.  
2. **Researched healthcare-targeted APTs** using SOCRadar Labs.  
3. **Mapped APT TTPs** into MITRE ATT&CK Navigator for visualization.  
4. **Conducted comparative analysis** to identify common attack vectors across groups.

## Example Finding
- **APT41** – China-based cyber-espionage group known for targeting healthcare and other industries.  
- Techniques observed: phishing, credential dumping, persistence mechanisms.

## Conclusion
The project highlights how **MITRE ATT&CK** can be leveraged for structured threat hunting.  
By mapping APT activity in the healthcare sector, security teams gain actionable insights into adversary behaviors and overlapping attack patterns, supporting stronger **defensive strategies**.
